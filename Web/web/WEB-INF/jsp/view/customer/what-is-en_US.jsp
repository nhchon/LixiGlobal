<p>What if you want to send someone a gift for their birthday in Vietnam?</p>

<p>Gift giving is a way of telling the other person that you care. In this global connected world, we all have friends and relatives in all corners of the world. But the challenges of giving someone overseas a gift is so daunting that we all ended up not doing it at all.</p>

<p>Lixi.Global understands the problems you face when you want to give a gift overseas. First, the gift must be delivered in a timely manner. Second, what if the receiver doesn’t like the gift.</p>

<p>We address the first issue by partnering with leading ecommerce company in the host country to purchase the gift for you. You buy a gift on our web site like you would buy a gift on any e-commerce site. We process your credit card and notify the receiver of your gift waiting for them.</p>

<p>The Receiver will get a description of the gift that you send and request delivery to their home address. All is done online. The gift will be delivered promptly in three to five days. </p>

<p>If the receiver doesn’t like the gift you send, they can request a cash refund online. No question asked. We deposit the money into their online account with our e-commerce partner in Vietnam and they can withdrawal it to their personal banking account anytime they want. It’s that simple.</p>

<p>We do all this for $0.99 fee per receiver. We allow up to five different re-ceivers on one order. </p>

<p>Caring has never been so affordable and effortless. Go for it. Tell them that you care for any occasion.</p>

<p>P.S. We start our service with Vietnam, but we won’t stop there…</p>
