                            <p>You can request a refund for nearly any purchase on Lixi.Global—for any reason. Maybe your PC doesn't meet the hardware requirements; maybe you bought a game by mistake; maybe you played the title for an hour and just didn't like it.</p>
                            <p>It doesn't matter. Valve will, upon request via <a href="https://lixi.global">lixi.global</a>, issue a refund for any reason, if the request is made within fourteen days of purchase, and the title has been played for less than two hours. There are more details below, but even if you fall outside of the refund rules we’ve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and we’ll take a look.</p>
                            <p>You will be issued a full refund of your purchase within a week of approval. You will receive the refund in Lixi.Global Wallet funds or through the same payment method you used to make the purchase. If, for any reason, Lixi.Global is unable to issue a refund via your initial payment method, your Lixi.Global Wallet will be credited the full amount. (Some payment methods available through Lixi.Global in your country may not support refunding a purchase back to the original payment method. <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds_methods">Click here for a full list</a>.)</p>
