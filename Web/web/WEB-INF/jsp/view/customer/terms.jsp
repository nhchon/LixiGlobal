Lixi.Global Services</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We recommend that you use the Service to send gifts to friends and family and, therefore, you should not use the Service to send money to strangers. This is not a money transferring service. Once the gift is “Processed”, you will not be able to cancel the service.</span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Paying for the Service:</span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_list_7-0 start"><li class="c1 c10"><span class="c3 c4">Charges. With each transaction you submit you are agreeing to pay us a service fee (Lixi.Global Fee), in addition to the Transaction Amount. Payment in US dollars is due at the time the transaction is submitted for processing. If you submit a transaction that results in us being charged NSF fees, chargeback fees, or other similar costs, you agree to reimburse Lixi.Global for all such fees. If you allow the Receivers to receive a refund, a “Processing Charge” will be added to your Transaction Amount.</span></li><li class="c10 c1"><span class="c3 c4">Payment. In order for us to process your transaction you authorize us to charge any of the payment instruments included in your payment profile (“Payment Instrument” includes your credit card, debit card or bank account). If your payment fails you authorize us to retry one or more times using the same payment instrument. You warrant that you are a lawful user of your Payment Instrument(s)</span></li><li class="c10 c1"><span class="c3 c4">Other Charges. We are not responsible for fees that may be imposed by financial institutions associated with your Payment Instruments. For example, some credit card issuers may treat the use of &nbsp;the Service as a “cash advance” and may impose additional fees and interest cost for the transaction. Lixi.Global is not responsible for any NSF fees, chargeback fees, or other, similar charges that might be imposed on you by your bank, credit card issuer, or other provider.</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c7 c1"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">2.

If the goods you ordered are not delivered to the designated person within 3 weeks, Lixi.Global will provide a refund of the purchase price excluding “Process Fee” and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Lixi.Global Fee” to you upon request, unless we have informed you at the time of your purchase of a specific delivery date beyond that time.</span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You have the right to choose either “Gift Only” or “Allow for Refund “ on the “Place Order” page for the receiver of your gift. </span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_list_8-0 start"><li class="c10 c1"><span class="c3 c4">If you choose “Gift Only”, the receiver through our third party partner can exchange the gift for another gift, but at no time will the designated receiver allow to receive a refund.</span></li></ul><p class="c7 c1"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_list_8-0"><li class="c10 c1"><span class="c3 c4">If you choose “Allow for Refund”, the receiver if not satisfied with the gift can receive the value of the gift in VND subjected to the exchange rate at the time you purchased the gift. We will make this amount available to the receiver in a virtual account that the receiver has signed up and verified with our partner in a reasonable time. It will be the responsibility of the receiver to move this money back to their personal account.</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">3.

Lixi.global and you will attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days from the date that any notice of dispute, claim, or controversy is sent. Lixi.global and you shall use reasonable, good faith, efforts to settle any dispute, claim, or controversy through consultation and good faith negotiations. After 30 days, Lixi.global or you may resort to the other alternatives described in this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice and 30 day negotiation period required by this paragraph shall not apply, however, to disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Lixi.global Sites.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c5"><span class="c3">Except as otherwise specifically set forth below, any dispute, claim, or controversy of any kind between Lixi.global and you arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Lixi.global Sites, any person's access to and/or use of the Lixi.global Sites, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the Lixi.global Sites, if unresolved through informal discussions within thirty (30) days of the sending of the notice described above, shall be resolved by binding arbitration to be held in the U.S. state in which you reside. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Phoenix, Arizona, and Lixi.global and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in Phoenix, Arizona to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c5"><span class="c3">Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Lixi.global Sites shall not be subject to arbitration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Use, and administered by the AAA.

You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including but not limited to attorney's fees and expert witness costs unless Lixi.global is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. For claims that total more than $1,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing fees and arbitration fees. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Lixi.global and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. Lixi.global and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Use and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney's fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lixi.global and you agree not to seek any attorney's fees and expert witness costs unless the arbitrator finds that a claim, defense or other fee- or cost-generating activity was asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or was frivolous. Lixi.global and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Lixi.global and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. Lixi.global and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c5"><span class="c3">If you or Lixi.global's claim is solely for monetary relief of $500 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c5"><span class="c3">You or Lixi.global may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and Lixi.global otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Lixi.global by email to </span><span class="c14"><a href="mailto:legal@Lixi.Global" class="c11">mailto:legal@Lixi.Global</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;AND by U.S. Mail to Lixi.global, Inc., 3329 W Apollo Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85041.

If you do not opt out via this method, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes, claims, or controversies in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs.

You must use the iOS app only on an Apple-branded product that runs iOS. Your use of the app must comply with the terms of use applicable to the Apple source from which you obtain it (including the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service). You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to furnish you with any maintenance and support services with respect to the app.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c5"><span class="c3">You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the app or your possession and use of the app, including, but not limited to (i) product warranty or liability claims; (ii) any claim that the app fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; or (iv) claims that the app infringes a third party's intellectual property rights.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c5"><span class="c3">In the event of any failure of the iOS version of the app to conform to any applicable warranty that has not been effectively disclaimed by these Terms of Use, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the app (if any) to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the app, and, as between Apple and Lixi.global, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty of Lixi.global will be Lixi.global's responsibility, but only to the extent provided by these Terms of Use.

Lixi.global may assign these Terms of Use in its sole discretion by providing you notice of the same. For example, Lixi.global may unconditionally assign or otherwise transfer these Terms of Use to any successor in interest, such as an acquirer of a Lixi.global company (via merger, sale of stock, etc.) or a buyer of substantially all of its assets.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c5"><span class="c3">Headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of any section.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c5"><span class="c3">Lixi.global's failure to enforce your strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of Lixi.global's right to enforce such provision or any other provision of these Terms of Use.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c5"><span class="c3">If any provision of this agreement is unlawful, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the agreement will remain in place, except as explained in the second-to-last paragraphs of the “Disputes/Arbitration” and “Class Action Waiver” sections.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c5 c13"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">23.
